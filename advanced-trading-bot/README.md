# Advanced Crypto Trading Bot Example

This example integrates [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) for exchange access and [freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) for the strategy interface. It expands on a simple bot with custom indicators and risk management features.

**Note:** This is illustrative code only. Running a trading bot with real funds carries financial risk. Thoroughly test and paper trade before going live.

## Features
- Fetches market data using `ccxt`.
- Implements a strategy subclassing `freqtrade`'s `IStrategy`.
- Uses EMA crossover with RSI confirmation.
- Demonstrates stop-loss, trailing stop, and dynamic position sizing.

Run `bot.py` to see how components fit together. You will need to install `ccxt` and `freqtrade` (which requires TA-Lib).
