# Advanced Crypto Trading Bot Example

This example integrates [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) for exchange access and [freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) for the strategy interface. It expands on a simple bot with custom indicators and risk management features.

**Note:** This is illustrative code only. Running a trading bot with real funds carries financial risk. Thoroughly test and paper trade before going live.

## Features
- Fetches market data using `ccxt`.
- Implements a strategy subclassing `freqtrade`'s `IStrategy`.
- Uses EMA crossover with RSI confirmation.
- Demonstrates stop-loss, trailing stop, and dynamic position sizing.

Run `bot.py` to see how components fit together. Install `ccxt` via `pip install ccxt`.
If you want to use Freqtrade's built-in tools and TAâ€‘Lib, install it with:

```bash
pip install 'freqtrade[strategy]'
```

The script also includes fallback indicator implementations so it can run without these optional dependencies, albeit with limited functionality.
